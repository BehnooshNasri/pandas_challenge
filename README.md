Notes and references: 
AskBCS assisted me with the following lines as I was getting errors that I couldn't fix: 
line 12: for the scool types they helped me to fix the output and instead of a list to make it into string to lose the brackets in the data frame. 
line 14: I had used the incorrect code to calculate the total budget and they helped me figure out how to fix it. 
Line 30: I had finished the assignment and when I restarted and re-ran I got an error on this line which was strange as I had ran it perfectly before. AskBCS also were perplexed as the codes seemed all correct but the error persisted. They then advised me to add "right=False" and refresh my bins and that took care of the issue.
